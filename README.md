# ssh-sessions
This simple script lists the running ssh sessions in your system and presents you with an option menu to ssh into any of the servers from the list of existing sessions. It can be seen as a simple time saver during times when multiple ssh connections to the same server are required.

## usage

Just run the script like any other linux executable. Also, you can add this script (path) to your system PATH.
